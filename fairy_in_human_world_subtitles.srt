00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One magical night... something entered our world.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A glowing light... descending from the sky.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
People stopped. Cameras came out. Eyes widened.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A fairy... real, gentle, and glowing with magic.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
She asked only one question...

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
"Why is your world so empty of wonder?"

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The city froze. Silence fell.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then... she vanished in a blink of light.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Was it a dream? Or did you see her too?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A fairy in our world... truth or tale?
